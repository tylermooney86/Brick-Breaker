Brick Breaker
========================

About
-----
Brick Breaker is a minimalist version of the classic game Breakout. It is the first game that I have made in Unity so I kept the project pretty simple. The game is rendered in 3D with a fixed 2D perspective. When the bricks are hit by the ball they are destroyed. When the bricks are destroyed they explode into a bunch of little cubes that make it difficult to pay attention to where the ball is. The explosions also add some force to the ball, causing it to accelerate. After all of the bricks are destoryed the level is increased. The difficulty level is increased by giving the bricks more hitpoints. when the bricks have more than 1 hitpoint they change color when they are hit and lose one hitpoint. The score is multiplied by the difficulty level ( each hit on a brick with 3 hitpoints is worth 300 points ).
